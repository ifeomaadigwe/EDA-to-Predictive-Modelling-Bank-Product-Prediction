# EDA-to-Predictive-Modelling-Bank-Product-Prediction
This repository contains an analysis of a bank phone campaign dataset, with the aim of understanding customer behavior, exploring the dataset, and predicting bank product subscriptions using machine learning.

The dataset was obtained from a Portuguese Bank that launched a direct marketing campaign on the phone in 2012. The data includes customer demographics, account status, and their interactions with the bank. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into customer behavior and to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank product during a direct marketing phone campaign.

The analysis was conducted using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) included bar charts, line charts, histograms, and heatmaps to identify trends and correlations within the data.

In addition to EDA, machine learning algorithms were implemented to predict the outcome of the bank phone campaign. Four algorithms, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier, were used for the analysis. Confusion Matrix and K-Fold Cross Validation were used to ensure the reliability of the predictions.

This repository contains the Python code used in the analysis, a README file explaining the steps taken, and visualizations of the EDA. The analysis provides valuable insights into the bank phone campaign dataset and showcases the use of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. The code and visualizations can serve as a useful reference for anyone looking to work with similar datasets or improve their skills in data analysis and machine learning.
